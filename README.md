GPA & CGPA Calculator â€“ Academic Performance Tracker

This project is a modern, web-based GPA and CGPA calculator designed to assist students in accurately tracking and projecting their academic performance. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application allows users to input grades and credit values for individual subjects per semester, based on a 10-point grading system (O = 10, A+ = 9, A = 8, B+ = 7, B = 6, C = 5). It dynamically calculates the current semester GPA and enables users to update their cumulative CGPA by incorporating previous academic records. The interface features a visually appealing, responsive design with support for both dark and light modes, a vibrant gradient background, and user-friendly controls. This project combines functionality and style, offering an intuitive tool for academic analysis and planning.
